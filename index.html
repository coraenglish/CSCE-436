We spent around 2 hours brainstorming ideas until we finally decided on the DYNAsauce. After writing about scope, challenges, impact, and different interactions we feel confident that this idea will be one to go the distance. The website was created and an initial mockup of what our product will look like was drawn up. This new take on the sauce bottle could be easily implemented, even without all of the features we plan to model. </p></div>

This was a very rudimentary creation based on our initial sketch and is refined later on in the project. The cardboard prototype was needed in order to have a basis to improve upon for our prototype used in future interations.</p></div>

The actual model was created out of plastic and will use the power of editing to show the true capability we want the product to have. Due to technical challenges, an actual prototype is not possible during this class, but all of the features with an integrated mobile app could be possible in the near future, if not now.</p></div>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The concept of our product is an “all in one” sauce bottle that can conserve space within a fridge by storing individual sauces that someone may want into one bottle while also allowing users the ability to mix their sauces to create new flavors. The inspiration for this concept comes from multicolored pens and pre-blended condiment combinations that are sold by companies like Heinz.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">The motivation for this product is to revolutionize the culinary experience that user’s have when they use condiments and sauces. The benefits that this product provides consumers include saving fridge space, limiting waste that comes from having large sauce bottles that aren’t totally used up when they expire, and by facilitating new culinary experiences for users by allowing them to easily try new sauces that are sourced from the sauces they already have. Our smart sauce bottle will have the ability to alert users when they are running low on a particular sauce and will alert users when it is accidentally left out of the fridge for too long.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">Similar to consumer printers with ink, we will employ subscription services and an online marketplace to allow consumers to stay stocked on their favorite sauces. Additionally, our system will incorporate machine learning and feedback systems for sauce combinations and individual condiments to recommend new pre-packaged sauces and combinations to users. By using the attached condi-view-cam, our smart sauce bottle will be able to make sauce recommendations for the user. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Heinz already sells sauces that are combinations of other sauces. The concept of having condiment combinations that are just a bottle squeeze away (like are concept) is conveyed here, but it is easy to see how having just a few of these special sauces alongside your normal sauces could take up a lot of fridge space. Additionally, if you happen to not like a particular sauce, you could be stuck with a relatively large bottle of it. With the DYNAsauceTM, each of the individual sauce components that go into above sauces could be stored in one bottle and all of these combinations would be accessible to the user without being fully committed to an entire bottle of said combination.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Other sauce bottle designs exist that would allow users to have multiple sauces available to them within the same bottle, but these designs lack the ability to have more than two sauces and the ability to dynamically mix the sauces that are within the bottle. These designs also aren’t as sustainable as our system would be since they don’t facilitate reuse by allowing users to easily reuse a side of the bottle. Our system’s intelligence also differentiates it from these types of products since it is able to detect when the bottle needs to be refrigerated and facilitates the process of replacing expired or used-up sauce. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">What Can Be Done:
                                        The creation of an ingredient-holding mechanism encapsulated in a bottle.
                                        A state-of-the-art and proprietary reusable sauce bottle.
                                        The creation of an algorithm to detect optimal sauce type depending on the food.

                                        The DYNAsauceTM can not create its own ingredients and must be continuously supplied.
                                        The DYNAsauceTM sauce optimization algorithm can not currently detect user-based allergens such as peanuts and shellfish. </p>

Because of this, he used to be forced to limit the variety of sauces he had on hand to conserve space. Thanks to the DYNAsauceTM, he is now able to cut down the fridge space that his sauces take up by a factor of 6 and no longer has to prioritize which sauces he keeps on hand.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">2. Nkemdi, a foodie that can be a little lazy while cooking and is stuck on a college budget, likes to try new things (such as prepackaged combinations of condiments and sauces), but doesn’t like financial commitment that buying a dedicated bottle presents. DYNAsauceTM allows him to easily experiment with combinations of sauces he already loves without having to buy dedicated mixes of them and without having to manually create mixes of them.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">3. Cora, someone who could be described as a sauce addict (she claims she could quit at any time if she wanted to), fears the thought of eating a meal without her favorite sauce that she likes with it. Thanks to DYNAsauceTM, she is always alerted that her favorite sauces are running low so she can order more before she reaches critically low levels. </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">4. Cora, someone who is busy but also urgently needs to order sauces sometimes, is able to conveniently and quickly order sauce refills directly through the DYNAsauceTM app. </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">5. Cora also tends to be someone who loves a good deal, so the sauce subscriptions that are offered through the app (that reorder at certain points such as monthly, weekly, or when sauce levels are low), allow her to more conveniently keep stocked up on her favorite sauces while also receiving small discounts on her subscribed sauces. </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">6. Kareem, who can sometimes be a control freak, is constantly worried about optimal storage for his sauces to ensure that they are stored at the proper temperature (to keep sauces as savory as possible). He can keep his mind at ease by being able to see the temperature indicator on the outside of the DYNAsauceTM. He is also able to view this reading via the mobile app thanks to the Bluetooth connection that can be made with the DYNAsauceTM.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">7. Kareem, someone who can get forgetful when his mind is occupied with something, can sometimes forget to put his sauces back in the fridge. Thanks to the DYNAsauceTM and its dedicated mobile app, he is able to get notifications when one of his DYNAsauceTM bottles is left out and should be put back in the refrigerator. </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">8. Mitchell, something of a sauce connoisseur, likes to keep some special sauces on hand for special occasions or food that he doesn’t typically eat. Unfortunately, this sauce can go bad sometimes (since it isn’t used very often) and could leave him disappointed that he can’t use the sauce. Thanks to DYNAsauceTM, he is able to be alerted when a sauce will be expiring so he can be prepared to use it early or reorder it when needed.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">9. Guy Fieri, a world renowned chef, always produces very unique and tasty food. Sometimes, he has everything down for a dish except the sauce. Thanks to the DYNAsauceTM, he is able to use the attached camera on the bottle (which uses machine learning behind the scenes) to get sauce recommendations for single sauces or sauce combinations to put on a dish. Guy is such a fan of this feature that he calls it a lifetime ticket to Flavortown in a bottle.</p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">10. Mitchell, a sauce fan who believes that variety is the spice of life, loves trying new things - particularly seasonal offerings from different brands. Thanks to the DYNAsauceTM, he is able to receive custom deals for sauces that machine learning models think he will like based on his previous sauce history. He is also notified through the app when he is able to order special seasonal sauces. </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">11. Nkemdi, a foodie who loves to experiment with different foods, sometimes struggles finding new things to try. Thanks to the friend feature in the DYNAsauceTM app, he is able to follow his other foodie friends and be alerted when they like a sauce that he hasn’t tried yet. He is also able to leave ratings for sauces that he has purchased. He really enjoys getting lost in the sauce with other foodies who share a similar passion for sauce. </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">12. Nkemdi, a foodie who considers his DYNAsauceTM to be one of the most used items in his house, is annoyed when things get in the way of him and his food (besides an obligatory picture of said food). Thanks to the DYNAsauceTM app, he is alerted well in advance that he needs to change out the battery in his DYNAsauceTM so he is not stuck changing its battery while he’d rather be putting sauce on his meal and enjoying it. </p>

                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">User satisfaction is the first and foremost concern of any consumer-facing products, and even more so with a product like DYNAsauceTM    which is a dynamic solution to consumer concerns. Therefore, the best measure of our product’s impact and success will be through direct feedback from our target audience and consumers in the form of surveys and first hand testimonies. Questionnaires will look to gather pertinent information on consumer-product interaction. Questions could include things like:
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">“Did the DYNAsauceTM  address your sauce-related needs?”
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">“Would you recommend the DYNAsauceTM  to your friends?”
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="mb-4">The second part of our impact measurement will focus on how the product’s functionality performs. The DYNAsauceTM  is a complex and dynamic tool with a myriad of options provided to the user. As part of our quality assurance and impact assessment, our goal is that each of these functionalities are equally appealing and applicable to the consumer, and if not, discern how to improve these shortcomings.</p>
